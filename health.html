                The base of The Alaskan husky sled dog in Alaska and Canada is the Native Village dog. The Interior Village dog is a leggier, rangier and taller dog that the coastal Eskimo Village types. Many mushers prefer the true husky dogs that they call: "Villagey", and although there are no pure native dogs left, some dogs still throw back to those looks.

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>
                Huskies, with proper care, have a typical lifespan ranging from twelve to fifteen years.[citation needed] Health 	issues in the breed are mainly genetic, such as seizures and defects of the eye (juvenile cataracts, corneal dystrophy, canine glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy) and congenital laryngeal paralysis. Hip dysplasia is not often found in this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing dysplasia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Siberian Huskies used for sled racing may also be prone to other ailments, such as gastric disease, bronchitis or bronchpulmonary ailments ("ski asthma"), and gastric erosions or ulcerations.
