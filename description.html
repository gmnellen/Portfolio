                A husky can come in any color or combination of color(s) ranging from pure white to pure black and anything in between. The eyes can be any color or combination of colors including light blue to dark blue, green. amber to dark brown. They can have two of the same color, one of each (bi-eyed) or eyes that have two colors in the same eye (parti-eyed). Any of these are normal.

            <h2>Coat</h2>
            <p>
                The Siberian Husky's coat is thicker than most other dog breeds, comprising two layers: a dense undercoat and a 	longer topcoat of short, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, but the coat also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as -50 to -60 °C (-58 to -76 °F). The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.  In hot areas a husky's coat can naturally change so the dog can adapt to hot temperatures.

            <p>
                Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, usually with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. The most common coats are black and white, then less common copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare "Agouti" coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. Merle coat patterns are not allowed.
            </p>
            <h2>Eyes</h2>
            <p>
                American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely." The eyes of a Siberian Husky are ice-blue, dark blue, amber, or brown. In some individual dogs, one eye may be brown and the other blue (completeheterochromia), or one or both eyes may be "parti-colored," that is, half brown and half blue (partial heterochromia) All of these eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club.
            </p>
            <h2>Nose</h2>
            <p>
                Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called "snow nose" or "winter nose." This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. "Snow nose" is acceptable in the show ring.
            </p>

            <h2>Tail</h2>
            <p>
                Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. The tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a "sickle" shape when excited or interested in something. It should be symmetrical, and not curved or deviated to the side; nor should it ever curl so much as to touch the back.
            </p>
            <h2>Size</h2>
            <p>
                The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 21 and 23.5 inches (53 and 60 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds (20 and 27 kg). Females are smaller, growing to between 20 to 22 inches (51 to 56 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 35 to 50 pounds (16 to 23 kg).
            </p>
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                The Husky has been described as a behavioral representative of the domestic dog's forebear, the wolf, exhibiting a wide range of its ancestors' behavior. They are known to howl rather than bark. If the dog is well trained when it's young, it can make a great family pet. The frequency of kenneled Siberian Huskies, especially for racing purposes, is rather high, as attributed through the history of the breed in North America. They are affectionate with people of all ages. Huskies will obey if required to, but their natural tendency is to be cooperative rather than obedient, and they prefer to be companions rather than mere pets.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fifteen-minute daily obedience training class will serve well for Siberian Huskies. Siberians need consistent training and do well with a positive reinforcement-training program. They rank 45th in Stanley Coren's, The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence. They tend to run because they were at first bred to be sled dogs. They were historically bred to be working and companion animals by the Chukchi people, and should always be gentle in nature. The Chukchi people use Siberian huskies to look after their children.
